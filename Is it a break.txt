//Is it a break game:

-Based on doubly linked list of nodes or python
-You are always second node

-Starts by asking "Are you down for a break"
-*IF* you respond: is it a break
	-it starts the game
-First node is head
	-you get added to second node
	-LOOPS, must go through each node
-30% chance to either add you as next node, or have random node as next

-Ends if you successfully complete N loops or if you fuck up
	-if you fuck up, prints out a random banned trait

-opens league on finish

-AESTHETIC ADDITIONS:
